# CLI Reference

## Service-Node

  * This command will compress your application and initialize the deployment.

    <br/>

    ```bash
    $ node glue deploy
    ```

    <br/>

    It's important to ensure that your application is properly configured and tested before running the deployment command, to avoid any issues or errors during the deployment process.
    
    <br/> 
    
  * The **deploy:watch** command is a variant of the deployment command that allows you to monitor the deployment process in real-time. When you run this command, it will compress your application and initiate the deployment process as usual, but it will also start a watch mode that allows you to view the deployment logs as they are generated.

    <br/>

    ```bash
    $ node glue deploy:watch
    ```

    <br/>

    The watch mode can be helpful for identifying and resolving issues during the deployment process, as it provides real-time feedback on the progress of the deployment and any errors or warnings that may occur.
